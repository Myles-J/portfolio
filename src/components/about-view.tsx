			<p>
				Hello, my name is Myles Jefferson. I am a self-taught developer with a
				passion for building elegant and user-friendly applications. Starting
				from humble beginnings, I spent time honing my skills in HTML, CSS/SCSS,
				TypeScript, React, NextJS, Node.js, Git, API development, SQL. In my
				professional experience, I have spent over{" "}
				{new Date().getFullYear() - 2022} years working on a variety of
				projects, from small web applications to large-scale enterprise systems.
				I have been able to collaborate with clients and team members to ensure
				that projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the highest
				standards of quality. Through this work, I have also become comfortable
				with Docker, Linux servers, agile development methodologies, test-driven
				development, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
				practices.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, learning with side
				projects, and participating in online communities. I believe that
				staying curious and constantly learning is key to being a successful
				developer. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so
				if you are interested in working together or have any questions, feel
				free to reach out. Let us build something great together!
